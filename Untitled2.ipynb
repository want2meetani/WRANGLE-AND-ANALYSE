They’re Good Dogs Brent wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",

The challenge lies in the fact that the Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information that comes in JSON format.

    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.We only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset requires exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues at minimum) need to be assessed and cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.We do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. We can, but note that we won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since we don't have access to the algorithm used."

    "I approached this project using the three steps of data wrangling: gather, assess, clean. In the gather phase, the image prediction data was downloaded using Python's Requests library. The additional Twitter information (i.e. retweet and favorite counts) was downloaded using the Twitter API. In the following assess step, I then inspected the generated data frames in order to find any quality or tidiness issues. The cleaning step subsequently involved implementing steps to fix the quality and tidiness issues that were previously identified.\n",
